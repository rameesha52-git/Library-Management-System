# Library-Management-System
The library management system being developed for this project makes it possible to run a library effectively. It offers features for keeping track of books, clients, staff, books being issued, and returns. Using SQL, the system keeps an extensive database of books together with information about their availability, rental price, and other pertinent aspects. It also makes it possible to handle patrons and staff members of the library efficiently.
